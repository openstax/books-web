Birds and insects flap their wings as they move through the air. Therefore, wings enable flight.</li>\n  <li>Insects generally survive mild winters better than harsh ones. Therefore, insect pests will become more problematic if global temperatures increase.</li>\n  <li>Chromosomes, the carriers of DNA, separate into daughter cells during cell division. Therefore, DNA is the genetic material.</li>\n  <li>Animals as diverse as insects and wolves all exhibit social behavior. Therefore, social behavior must have an evolutionary advantage for humans.</li>\n</ol>\n",
